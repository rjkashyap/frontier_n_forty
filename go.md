<p><strong>&ldquo;For this is what the Lord has commanded us: &lsquo;I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:47)</p>
<p>The call to spread the gospel is a mission for all believers, and short-term field opportunities provide a powerful way to engage in this work. These opportunities are designed for those who wish to make an immediate impact by serving in unreached nations within the 10/40 Window.</p>
<p><strong>What to Expect:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Duration:</strong> Typically 2-3 weeks.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Activities:</strong> Share the gospel following Jesus&rsquo; instructions from Luke chapter 10, learn the local language and culture, and build relationships with the people you serve.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>When:</strong> Every summer and winter.</p>
<p>You play your part in fulfilling the Great Commission by bringing the message of Jesus Christ to people who have never heard before. This experience offers a unique opportunity to see God's work in action and deepen your understanding of His mission. You do this trip in partnership with long term missionaries who receive you, briefly equip you and then send you under their prayer covering. This way, people who hear the gospel through you have the opportunity to be discipled even after you have left the field.</p>

<p><strong>Long-Term Field Opportunities</strong></p>
<p><strong>"And on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."&nbsp; </strong>Matthew 16:18</p>
<p>Long-term field opportunities are for those committed to a more extended period of service, focusing on church planting and deep cultural engagement. These roles require significant preparation and dedication to serve in frontier areas within the 10/40 Window. This commitment allows missionaries to build deep relationships, understand local cultures, and address both spiritual and practical needs effectively. The true value of long-term missions lies in their ability to lay a strong foundation for churches that thrive and grow over generations. Yes, the cost is significant and the lasting impact on communities and the church makes this enduring commitment invaluable, embodying the patience and dedication necessary for true, transformative gospel work.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> The length and nature of your training will vary depending on your ministry vision for the nation. Sometimes a big part of the training can happen in the field under the supervision and apprenticeship of a long-term missionary team. We will make sure that a long term missionary is sent after being fully prepared for the challenges ahead.</p>
