<p><strong>Join Us for Two Transformative Weekends of Mission and Ministry</strong></p>
<p>Are you ready to deepen your understanding of global missions and how they connect with both the present and future of the Church? Over two consecutive weekends, we invite you to embark on a journey that will challenge, inspire, and equip you for the Great Commission.</p>
<p>On the first&nbsp;<strong>Weekend</strong>, missionary&nbsp;<strong>Paul Park</strong>&nbsp;will guide us through the prophetic significance of global evangelism under the theme&nbsp;<strong>"Mission &amp; The End Times."</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll delve into how the spread of the gospel to unreached nations fulfills key biblical prophecies, and how rapid church growth in regions like India, China, and Iran is shaping the future of missions today.</p>
<p>Then, in the second&nbsp;<strong>Weekend</strong>, we shift focus to&nbsp;<strong>"Sustainable Mission"</strong>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>David Riddell</strong>, a leading voice in ministry and counseling. This weekend will equip you with the tools to ensure that your mission not only impacts lives today but also endures for generations. From balancing personal life and ministry, to the critical role of mental health, relationships, and finances, you'll gain practical insights to sustain your calling for the long haul.</p>
<p>Whether you're new to missions or seeking deeper wisdom to continue your work, these two weekends will leave you spiritually enriched, practically equipped, and ready to take your place in God&rsquo;s unfolding plan for the nations.</p>
