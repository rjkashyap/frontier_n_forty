<p><strong>Join Us for Two Transformative Weekends of Mission and Ministry</strong></p>
<p>Are you ready to deepen your understanding of global missions and how you can live a life driven by it? At the &#34;GO&#34; Mission Weekend, &#40;1 &amp; 2 November&#41;, we invite you to embark on a journey that will challenge, inspire, and equip you for the Great Commission.</p>
<p>During this event, led by <strong>David Riddell</strong>, a leading voice in ministry and counselling, we will focus on the topic of "<strong>Sustainable Mission</strong>". You'll gain practical tools to ensure your mission impacts lives today and lasts for generations. Topics include balancing personal life and ministry, mental health, relationships, and finances.</p>
