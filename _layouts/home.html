<p><strong>Join Us for Two Transformative Weekends of Mission and Ministry</strong></p>
<p>Are you ready to deepen your understanding of global missions and how they connect with both the present and future of the Church? Over two consecutive weekends, we invite you to embark on a journey that will challenge, inspire, and equip you for the Great Commission.</p>
<p>On the first weekend, with guest speaker missionary <strong>Paul Park</strong>, we will explore the theme "<strong>Mission &amp; The End Times</strong>", learning about the connection between the advancement of the Gospel and the fulfilment of&nbsp;biblical prophecies and how rapid church growth in regions like India, China, and Iran is shaping the future of missions.</p>
<p>The second weekend, led by <strong>David Riddell</strong>, we will focus on "<strong>Sustainable Mission</strong>". You'll gain practical tools to ensure your mission impacts lives today and lasts for generations. Topics include balancing personal life and ministry, mental health, relationships, and finances.</p>
<p>Whether you're new to missions or seeking deeper wisdom to continue your work, these two weekends will leave you spiritually enriched, practically equipped, and ready to take your place in God&rsquo;s unfolding plan for the nations.</p>
