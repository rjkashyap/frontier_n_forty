				<p>The Frontier Mission Fund allows our ministry to train, send and support missionaries who serve among the unreached peoples of the earth. We dream of a day when at least 50% of the global mission force is focused on the 10/40 Window and when more than 50% of all mission funding internationally is directed towards reaching people for Jesus in this region. You can play your part by investing in our mission initiatives. </p>
