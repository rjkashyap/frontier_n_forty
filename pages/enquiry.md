<p>The Global Mission School training program is designed to awaken Christians to God's big-picture purpose, His deep love for all nations, and His desire to use His people to be a blessing on this earth. Through weekly lectures, participants will learn how God has been advancing His kingdom throughout history. They will be inspired and challenged to actively engage in God's mission of bringing all nations back to Him. These seven weeks will transform participants' worldview, helping them recognize that they have been blessed to be a blessing to all nations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Global Mission School can be offered in two formats: either weekly lectures spanning 7-8 weeks, or an intensive weekend program.</p>
<p>Topics Include (but not limited to):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&bull; An introduction to Mission<br />&bull; History of Global Mission<br />&bull; Insights into Culture (Nations and Religions)<br />&bull; Understanding the 10/40 Window<br />&bull; Spiritual Warfare &amp; Intercession<br />&bull; Mission &amp; the Last Days<br />&bull; Heart of the Great Commission</p>
