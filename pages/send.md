<p>At the heart of global missions is the vision of becoming a "sending church." This is a church that intentionally equips and sends its members to take the gospel to the nations. What started as an unfamiliar concept has now become a widespread movement among churches. Today, many local congregations are embracing their role in God&rsquo;s mission by preparing and sending cross-cultural missionaries with purpose and intentionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building a Missionary Identity</strong></p>
<p>To become a sending church, it&rsquo;s essential to cultivate a missionary identity within your congregation. Every member should see themselves as a disciple who makes disciples, whether they are reaching out in their local community or being sent across the globe. This mindset shifts missions from being a separate program to becoming a core part of the church's identity. By fostering this culture, your church empowers its members to live out their calling wherever they are, preparing them to be effective in gospel work both locally and in the mission field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Sending Culture</strong></p>
<p>Healthy churches are committed to sending their best leaders into the mission field, even when it&rsquo;s challenging (think the Antioch church sending Paul and Barnabas). By doing so, they demonstrate a deep commitment to God&rsquo;s mission and allow others within the church to step up and grow in leadership. Developing a sending culture within your church may involve intentional planning and a willingness to let go of key leaders, but the rewards&mdash;both for the church and the global mission&mdash;are immense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Planning Your Mission Journey</strong></p>
<p>Before diving into missions, it&rsquo;s crucial to lay a solid foundation. Understanding who you are as a church, what your mission convictions are, and what unique gifts your congregation offers will guide your approach. Whether you&rsquo;re starting from scratch or building on an existing program, thoughtful planning will set the stage for a fruitful missions journey. Appoint a dedicated missions leader, stay open to learning from others, and carefully consider how your church can best contribute to the global mission.</p>
